Here's the thing -   

I created this site three months ago out of a personal need for more harmonious record keeping - I had notes, code, ideas, and goals filed away on different notebooks, online as emails, in Google Drive, on Dropbox, on Github - the amount of info to sort only increases, so I thought having a website where I could put all of my own stuff for my own good would be helpful. The thing was, I tend to spend a lot of time having to figure things out for myself - especially with my bioinformatic work - but I don't come from a computer science background, so I tend to write little text documents describing *to myself* what it was that I did to get something to finally (hopefully) work properly. I've accumulated a lot of those little notes, and realized that in addition to enjoying the battles I've fought with computers, I also really enjoy helping others reduce their pain and just show them what to do in a more streamlined fashion. It was out of that combination: a place for all my crap, a place to retain instructions for personal use, and a place that acted as a teaching tool that this site hopefully will have meaning.  

`side note #1: the site's name is exactly what it's all about - taking principles that seem insurmountable and distilling them into plain English `

So my first big question was how do I create a site? I ultimately settled on a solution and started to construct my first post explaining exactly how to get this complicated process off the ground (at least for me as a total novice with respect to HTML, GitHub, and computer programming in general). But #LIFEhappens, something came up, and I had to leave about 8 hours of progress at a standstill - I got the website up and running, but ... well I didn't write any of the instructions down! Of course I forgot how I did what I did, and well, that is kind of the **ENTIRE POINT** of this website. Three months later, I had to spend hours and hours retracing my steps... sound familiar?  

`side note #2: there isn't a single content area I'm interested in distilling, but I'm largely interested in the interface of education, data science, and biology`

As a scientist, I'm supposed to be trained in the dark arts of expert record keeping, but the reality is that it's really time consuming to keep such detailed notes, and I've found myself to be more and more impatient as I've gotten older (but apparently not wiser). This site reflects my first earnest attempt to not only document the things that are really easy to do **once you know what you're doing** but are _REALLY HARD_ if you've **never done them before**. Not having documented the step-by-step process of constructing this site led me to having to sift through scattered bits of code I had created to figure out what I had done in the first place, _which took way, way longer than it should have_. I'm not going to do that again, and plan on continually updating this site with both "how to" posts which I hope you'll find useful.   

So how will this all work?  

The layout, as mentioned on the [Home page](https://devonorourke.github.io/) is really simple:
1. There's a page where I'll introduce the topic we're dealing with in a blog format - like the very one you're reading right now - under the [Learning](https://devonorourke.github.io/learning/) page. In some instances the entirety of the post will be self contained (read: if it's really simple). In other cases I might write a short blog outlining the basic premise of the project but then link to a separate page where the gory details are provided in full - specifically, you'll find these longer posts under the [Teaching](https://devonorourke.github.io/teaching/) page. For example, if you're interested in how to build a website like this one from scratch, I've documented [that process here]**(??? link ???)**.  

2. There's a [Doing](https://devonorourke.github.io/doing/) page where I'll provide overviews about the science I've been involved with. Interested in experimental evolution of microbial communities? Me too! How about white nose syndrome and the genetics of adaptation? Also me too! How about poop!? Not so much? Well I think it can be pretty useful. It's my hope to share as much of the techniques and results as I can in a detailed yet approachable way.

3. As mentioned in the first point, you'll find the [Teaching](https://devonorourke.github.io/learning/) page particularly useful for extensive documentation outlining how do do a process introduced in a blog. Buyer beware - code changes quick, so be sure to take not of when the post was written as things may have changed (possibly substantially).  

I always appreciate feedback so feel free to [get a hold of me](mailto:devon.orourke@gmail.com) if you have a comment.  

Thanks for visiting!
