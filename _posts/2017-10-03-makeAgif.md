In creating *'how to'* posts I've found that there are plenty of times where a screen capture would save me *loads* of time rather than typing out step by step instructions. While static screen grabs are often used, there are moments where a video recording of my screen would be much more helpful. Unfortunately the Markdown syntax used within these Github-hosted pages doesn't allow for the import of certain file types; namely video-style formats of any kind. Bummer.  

Fortunately there is a workaround - you can import .gif files and treat them just like static images as far as the Markdown syntax is concerned. My workflow for generating through publishing .gif files in a Markdown style format is as follows.  

## Step 1 - Make your movie
I have a Mac, which has Quicktime, which is just about all I ever need to do basic screen capture work. See [this tutorial](http://etc.usf.edu/techease/4all/getting-started/creating-screen-recordings-with-quicktime-player/) for one example (there are many) using such an approach. Ultimately you need to generate a .mov file to carry on to **Step 2** next.  

## Step 2 - Install software to convert .mov file to .gif
Thanks to Alex D for this *suuuper* easy to use piece of software: [screengif](https://github.com/dergachev/screengif) Install instructions are provided on the default README.md page, but note you're going to have to also install a few dependencies. In case that's unfamiliar I'll walk you through it a few ways starting from the ground up. I've found his existing instructions are outdated if you're using a Mac OS >= Sierra, which I'll point out explicitly below:

> To the impatient - see [his page](https://github.com/dergachev/screengif) for a quick Docker-based implementation if you know what you're doing...  

- Do you have the Homebrew package manager installed? Great - this is going to be easy. Use Conda or something else? You'll have to look elsewhere for guidance in this instance.  
  - No Homebrew? See my [earlier blog post](https://devonorourke.github.io/2017-10-05-freshStart/) about install options including Homebrew.
  - No package mamanger at all? - [here's a primer](https://www.slant.co/topics/511/~best-mac-package-managers)  

- Do you have Ruby installed? If yes, proceed.
  - No? See lots of alternative [install info here](http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html), but I'm assuming you're doing it either the Brew way:  
  ```
  brew install ruby
  ```

If you're set up with Homebrew, install of the program is a breeze and almost follows his instructions exactly:
```
## install xquartz if you haven't already:
brew cask install xquartz
open /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/xquartz/2.7.9/XQuartz.pkg # runs the XQuartz installer

## install program and other dependencies
brew install ffmpeg gifsicle pkg-config   # note we have dropped install of imagemagick
brew install imagemagick@6 && brew link imagemagick@6 --force # critical extra line for newer Mac OS'
gem install screengif
```

You'll notice instructions above are slightly different from the default instructions in two ways:
- 1) I've taken out the `imagemagick` program from the default install with `brew install ...`  
- 2) I've added a line: the `brew install imagemagick@6 && brew link ...`. Turns out that without running that extra line you'll get an error message if you try to run `screengif` because apparently something about the `imagemagick` program by itself fails to coordinate with `Ruby`. See [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39494672/rmagick-installation-cant-find-magickwand-h) for an extended discussion. Those changes should sufficiently allow you to install the program. You can test this with:  

```
screengif
```

Which should print out the help menu.  

```
No input file available.
screengif.rb - Convert your screencast into a gif.
Usage:
	screengif.rb [options] [--input FILENAME.mov] [--output OUTPUTFILE.gif]
Examples:
	./screengif.rb --input demo.mov --output out.gif
	cat somefile.gif | ./screengif.rb --progressbar --framerate 10 --delay 50 --delay-last 5 > out.gif

Specific options:
    -i, --input FILENAME.mov         Use ffmpeg to convert FILENAME.mov into PPM image stream and process results.
                                     If missing, will process PPM or GIF image stream from STDIN.
    -o, --output FILENAME.gif        Output resulting GIF data to FILENAME.gif. (defaults to STDOUT).
    -p, --progressbar                Overlay progress bar on the animation.
    -d, --delay MS                   Animation frame delay, in tens of ms. (default: 10)
        --delay-last MS              Animation frame delay of last frame, in tens of ms. (default: 50)
    -r, --framerate FPS              Specify amount of frames per second to keep. (default: 5)
    -w, --max-width PIXELS           Output image max width, in pixels.
        --max-height PIXELS          Output image max height, in pixels.
        --no-contrast                Skip increasing contrast using imagemagick.
    -f, --fuzz PERCENT               Imagemagick fuzz factor for color reduction. (default: 5%)
        --no-coalesce                Skip Magick::ImageList#coalesce() if input doesn't need it.
        --no-gifsicle                Prevent filter the output through gifsicle. Greatly increases output file size.
    -h, --help                       Show this message
    -v, --verbose                    Verbose output
        --version                    Show version
```

## Step 3 - run the software
Look at the print out of that help menu for all usage parameters. I've found that their default usage is sufficient to generate a moderately sized .gif for videos between 30 seconds to 1 minute.


## Step 4 - insert a .gif file with Markdown syntax
This step is easy. You just insert the .gif as if it's any old image file.  

That's it!
