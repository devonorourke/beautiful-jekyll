# A good overview of what's going on in the lab:
My graduate research has focused on understanding aspects of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of endemic bat populations. I pair high throughput molecular tools with next-generation sequencing technologies to gather genetic information. In some cases the information is from the bats themselves (see **Bat Genomics** below), and in other cases the genetic information concerns what the bats are eating (see **Bat Diets**).

Check out the information below for further information about each project. Feel free to contact me at [devon.orourke@gmail.com](mailto:devon.orourke@gmail.com) if you'd like to know more details about the research.

## Bat Diets
One aspect of this research relies on bat poop (guano) to describe the seasonal and geographic variation in the diets of bats native to New England. Understanding changes in the diversity and composition of insect species consumed by bats can greatly improve pest management strategies, inform conservation efforts, and shape land use strategies of forested areas affected by invasive pests. We pair high throughput molecular tools with next-generation sequencing technologies to quantify which bats eat what insects, when they eat them, and associate these dynamics with changes in community composition.
