# Current research:
My graduate research has focused on understanding aspects of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of endemic bat populations. I pair high throughput molecular tools with next-generation sequencing technologies to gather genetic information. In some cases the information is from the bats themselves (see **Bat Genomics** below), and in other cases the genetic information concerns what the bats are eating (see **Bat Diets**).

Check out the information below for further information about each project. Feel free to contact me at [devon.orourke@gmail.com](mailto:devon.orourke@gmail.com) if you'd like to know more details about the research.

## Bat Diets  

You can learn a lot from a pile of bat poop (guano). I'm interested in using guano samples to better understand the seasonal and geographic variation in the diets of bats native to New England. Understanding changes in the diversity and composition of insect species consumed by bats can greatly improve pest management strategies, inform conservation efforts, and shape land use strategies of forested areas affected by invasive pests. I spoke about the utility of this approach last year at a University of New Hampshire competition which challenged students to describe their research in three minutes or less:

We're still in the process of wrapping up the sequencing of thousdands of guano samples, and in an effort to keep everything up to date I'll keep posting updates [like this first one outlining the research in greater detail](http://www.outermostlab.com/2018-01-14-guano/). Notably, the majority of the data has yet to be analyzed, but the following graphic illustrates one way to think about such data. The graphic represents guano collected in New Hampshire during just the 2015 summer season.
