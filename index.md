# What are you doing here?

To get started, read my [first post](http://www.outermostlab.com/2017-09-26-beginning/) explaining what this site is all about. In short, this site contains elements of my graduate research, my teaching, and my thoughts, in a somewhat coherent manner. I've grouped this site into three big items:  

- [**Learning**](https://devonorourke.github.io/learning) - a bunch of _how-to_-type posts integrating some of the behind the things I felt were really important but no one ever taught me directly that I've picked up during my graduate work; typically involves code, but always simplified for first-timers like myself  
- [**Doing**](https://devonorourke.github.io/doing) - as up to date as I can be in sharing my current research at the University of New Hampshire  
- [**Teaching**](https://devonorourke.github.io/teaching) - a collection of curriculum that outline how we do real science in real courses real fast

See the links above for more info. See the links below for connecting with me.
